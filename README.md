## VBA Code for Stock Market Data

## Overview
The challenge entails creating a VBA script to automate the analysis of stock market data for multiple stocks over a year. The script extracts key information like ticker symbols, yearly and percentage changes, and total stock volume, offering a comprehensive view of each stock's performance.

## Purpose
The purpose is to streamline stock analysis through automation, utilizing VBA to efficiently process data on each stock. The script's added functionality identifies top performers, aiding in trend detection. Its ability to run across all worksheets ensures scalability, demonstrating programming and Excel proficiency while facilitating data-driven decision-making in finance.


Solving this problem created lots of roadblocks but also was a very fun challenge to solve. It was very fulfilling to see my code spitting out the desired data in the needed formatting.
